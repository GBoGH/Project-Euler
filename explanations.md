### Problem number 1.

> If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
> Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

```python
# Challenge number 1.
multiples = []
def ch1(x):
    for i in range(x):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            multiples.append(i)
        if i % 5 == 0:
            if i not in multiples:
                multiples.append(i)
    print(sum(multiples))

# Answer is: 233168.
ch1(1000)
```

Function checks whether number in given range is divisble by three: ``` if i % 3 == 0: ```, than it chceck whether the same number is divisible by five: ```if i % 5 == 0```. As a last step, it chcecks if the number is not already in list multiples: ```if i not in multiples```. If all three conditions are fulfilled, the number is added to list which is than added together.


### Problem number 2.

> Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms   will be:  
> 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...  
> By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

```python
# Challenge number 2.
numbers = [0, 1]
evens = []
def ch2(x):
    while (numbers[-1] + numbers[-2]) < x:
        numbers.append((numbers[-1] + numbers[-2]))
        if (numbers[-1] + numbers[-2]) % 2 == 0:
            evens.append((numbers[-1] + numbers[-2]))
    print(sum(evens))

# Answer is: 4613732
ch2(4000000)
```

There are more ways to solve fibonacci number in python, I chose probably the slower one but it is usable in this case as it is not dealing with large numbers. Otherwise regression would be better approach. The principle used is that this function adds numbers to list and than adds the last two values: ```numbers[-1] + numbers[-2]```. Than it selects the even numbers from complete list: ```if (numbers[-1] + numbers[-2]) % 2 == 0:``` and adds them to list of even fibonacci numbers: ```evens.append((numbers[-1] + numbers[-2]))```. Than the function returns sum of values present in the evens list.
